### Description

**Project Workflow**: Your commit history is really good, and so is your readme. Good work!

**Technical Requirements**: You have a win condition and a loss condition, and you've used a constructor function. Good work!

**Creativity**: Your game is so impressive in its conception -- you had this idea of taking the concepts you wanted to get across and making them into a game, and it worked really well for you. That's fantastic, and it takes a lot of creativity to take something like this and turn it into a game.

**Code Quality**: Overall, your code is clean, but there are some oddities in it that are just a little strange. For example, in a couple of your arrays, you're doing something like this (it's [here](https://github.com/kaizenagility/PieInTheSky/blob/master/script.js#L41) in your code:

```js
const myArray = [
  thing1 = {
    key: value,
  },
  thing2 = {
      key: value,
  },
];
```

This is not really good practice -- arrays should be used for storage, not for assigning things. The side effect of this is that `thing1` and `thing2` are available in those variables in the global scope, but I can't see that you've used them at all, and it could cause issues for you later. Also, you have one _very_ long `if/else` statement with a lot of things happening within it.  Instead of keeping it all in one if/else statement, like this:

```js
//******** Next Level ********//

      else if ((levelCounter >= 7) && (level <= 4)) {
        level++;
        lNum++;
        lives+=2;
        levelCounter = 0;
        plateInterval -= 1000; //Speed up the rate of falling plates in next level.
        levelUp.play();
        $('#alert').addClass('nextLevel');
        $('#alert.nextLevel').css('display', 'block');
        $('.plates').remove();
        $('#level').text('Level ' + level);
        $('#levelTitle').text(levels[lNum].title);
        $('#stage').css('background-image', 'url(' + levels[lNum].background + ')');
        $('#lives').text('Lives: ' + lives);
        $('#unicyclist').css('height', (parseInt($('#unicyclist').css('height', '150px'))));
        clearInterval(animate);
      }
```

It would have been better to do something like this:

```js
// stuff up here
else if ((levelCounter >= 7) && (level <= 4)) {
  nextLevel(level, lNum, lives, plateInterval, levelCounter);
  levelUp.play();
  clearInterval(animate);
}
// further down in the code 

function nextLevel(level, lNum, lives, plateInterval, levelCounter) {
    level++;
    lNum++;
    lives+=2;
    levelCounter = 0;
    plateInterval -= 1000; //Speed up the rate of falling plates in next level.
    $('#alert').addClass('nextLevel');
    $('#alert.nextLevel').css('display', 'block');
    $('.plates').remove();
    $('#level').text('Level ' + level);
    $('#levelTitle').text(levels[lNum].title);
    $('#stage').css('background-image', 'url(' + levels[lNum].background + ')');
    $('#lives').text('Lives: ' + lives);
    $('#unicyclist').css('height', (parseInt($('#unicyclist').css('height', '150px'))));
}
```

So that if you need to change some of the behavior in `nextLevel`, you don't have to search through your huge if statement for it -- you can just alter that one function.

**Deployment**: All good :thumbsup:

Overall, you did great work and should be proud of yourself. For your project two, focus on:
- Keeping everything extremely clean and modular
- Improving your code quality even more
